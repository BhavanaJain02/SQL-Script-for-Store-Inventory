# SQL-Script-for-Store-Inventory


Below is an SQL code snippet designed for the streamlined creation of tables with essential constraints, enabling the construction of a STORE INVENTORY platform. This platform serves the purpose of maintaining comprehensive records of product movements within a system, including quantities and detailed logs for every material transaction.

The table structures are meticulously designed, employing unique identifiers (IDs) for all products, suppliers, customers, and orders. This approach ensures efficient retrieval of data whenever required. The project was developed specifically for the Oracle APEX platform, boasting a user-friendly frontend and a seamlessly functioning backend.

Feel free to utilize and modify this code for your own inventory management system on the GitHub platform.
